['now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;', 'some airy devil hovers in the sky', "and pours down mischief. austria's head lie there,", 'while philip breathes.']['hubert, keep this boy. philip, make up:', 'my mother is assailed in our tent,', "and ta'en, i fear."]['my lord, i rescued her;', 'her highness is in safety, fear you not:', 'but on, my liege; for very little pains', 'will bring this labour to an happy end.']
