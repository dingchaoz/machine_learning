['now all the youth of england are on fire,', 'and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:', "now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought", 'reigns solely in the breast of every man:', 'they sell the pasture now to buy the horse,', 'following the mirror of all christian kings,', 'with winged heels, as english mercuries.', 'for now sits expectation in the air,', 'and hides a sword from hilts unto the point']
